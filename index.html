    <h1 class="text-align-center">Welcome to the Center for Community Learning</h1>
    <p>The Center for Community Learning convenes people within and beyond WWU to learn together.</p>
    
    <p>We play a central role in the university's work to engage with place, provide meaningful real-world learning opportunities for our diverse students, and serve communities throughout the state of Washington and beyond.</p>
    
    <p>Our work includes communities of practice, forums, work parties, community-based student employment, tours, retreats, and more. We help people build meaningful relationships, develop collaborations, and discover new ways to do their work that responds to the past, present, and future needs of our region and planet.</p>
    
    <p>Enjoy this video, produced for our Learning Together Trainings Series, which gives you a sense of the culture and spirit of our work:</p>

          Travis's childhood adventures in the Driftless Area of Wisconsin (Sauk and Meskwaki territory) and Alaska's Kodiak
          Archipelago (Alutiiq/Sugpiak territory) inspired his curiosity about people and place, and his eagerness to help our
          species live more peacefully, collaboratively, and gently. He received his Ph.D. in Geography from the University of
          Wisconsin-Madison, and is an honorary member of the Wenger-Trayner Social Learning Lab. Travis's family has lived in
          Bellingham's Happy Valley neighborhood since 2015.

          Ellie Duncan grew up in Western Montana (Séliš territory) and spent her childhood immersed in the creeks, hills, and
          woodlands of the Bitterroot valley. Her desire to connect deeply with place led her to work on vegetable farms across
          the region and to study sustainable food systems and wilderness studies at the University of Montana. She moved to the
          Pacific Northwest in 2016 and has been running City Sprouts Farm, a food access focused urban farm in Bellingham since
          2018. Her work is motivated by helping others pursue the joy and meaning that comes from connecting to the land and to
          each other.
